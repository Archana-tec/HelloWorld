      "Summary: The 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was the 12th Cricket World Cup, a quadrennial One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament contested by men's national teams and organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament was hosted between 30 May and 14 July across 10 venues in England and a single venue in Wales. It was the fifth time that England had hosted the World Cup,  while for Wales it was their third. \n",
      "The tournament was contested by 10 teams, a decrease from 14 teams in the previous edition, with the format of the tournament changing to a single round-robin group with the top four teams qualifying through to the knockout stage. After six weeks of round-robin matches, which saw four games not have a result, India, Australia, England, and New Zealand finished as the top four, with Pakistan missing out on net run rate.\n",
      "In the knockout stage, England and New Zealand won their respective semi-finals to qualify for the final, which was played at Lord's in London. The final ended in a tie after the match ended with both teams scoring 241 runs, followed by the first Super Over in an ODI; England won the title, their first, on the boundary countback rule after the Super Over also finished level. The total attendance throughout the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup was 752,000.\n",

      "Summary: The Cricket World Cup, officially known as ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, is the international championship of One Day International (ODI) cricket. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and considered as the \"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\" by the ICC. It is widely considered the pinnacle championship of the sport of cricket.\n",
      "The first World Cup was organised in England in June 1975, with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate Women's Cricket World Cup had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a triangular tournament of Test matches was played between Australia, England and South Africa. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the 1987 tournament onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an unofficial rotation system, with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\n",
      "The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 10 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation, compete for the title at venues within the host nation over about a month. In the 2027 edition, the format will be changed to accommodate an expanded 14-team final competition.A total of twenty teams have competed in the 13 editions of the tournament, with ten teams competing in the recent 2023 tournament. Australia has won the tournament six times, India and West Indies twice each, while Pakistan, Sri Lanka and England have won it once each. The best performance by a non-full-member team came when Kenya made the semi-finals of the 2003 tournament.\n",

      "Summary: The United States is a highly developed/advanced market economy. It is the world's largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) behind China. It has the world's seventh-highest per capita GDP (nominal) and the eighth-highest per capita GDP (PPP) as of 2022. The U.S. accounted for 25.4% of the global economy in 2022 in nominal terms, and around 15.6% in PPP terms. The U.S. dollar is the currency of record most used in international transactions and is the world's reserve currency, backed by a large U.S. treasuries market, its role as the reference standard for the petrodollar system, and its linked eurodollar. Several countries use it as their official currency and in others it is the de facto currency.The American economy is fueled by high productivity, a well developed transportation infrastructure, and extensive natural resources. Americans have the highest average household and employee income among OECD member states. In 2021, they had the highest median household income. The U.S. has one of the world's highest income inequalities among the developed countries. The largest U.S. trading partners are Canada, Mexico, China, Japan, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, India, and Vietnam. The U.S. is the world's largest importer and second-largest exporter. It has free trade agreements with several countries, including Canada and Mexico (through the USMCA), Australia, South Korea, Israel, and several others that are in effect or under negotiation.By 1890, the United States had overtaken the British Empire as the world's most productive economy. It is the world's largest producer of petroleum and natural gas. In 2016, it was the world's largest trading country as well as its third-largest manufacturer, with its manufacturing industry representing a fifth of the global manufacturing output. The U.S. not only has the largest internal market for goods, but also dominates the services trade. U.S. total trade amounted to $4.2 trillion in 2018. Of the world's 500 largest companies, 121 are headquartered in the U.S. The U.S. has the world's highest number of billionaires, with a total wealth of $3.0 trillion. US commercial banks had $22.9 trillion in assets as of December 2022. U.S. global assets under management had more than $30 trillion in assets. During the Great Recession of 2008, the U.S. economy suffered a significant decline. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act was passed by the US administration, and in the years that followed, the U.S. experienced the longest economic expansion on record by July 2019.The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the world's largest stock exchanges by market capitalization and trade volume. In 2014, the U.S. economy was ranked first in international ranking on venture capital and global research and development funding. Consumer spending comprised 68% of the U.S. economy in 2022, while its labor share of income was 44% in 2021. The U.S. has the world's largest consumer market. The nation's labor market has attracted immigrants from all over the world and its net migration rate is among the highest in the world. The U.S. is one of the top-performing economies in studies such as the Ease of Doing Business Index, the Global Competitiveness Report, and others.\n",

      "The three U.S. states with the highest GDPs were California ($3.6 trillion), Texas ($2.356 trillion), and New York ($2.053 trillion). The three U.S. states with the lowest GDPs were Vermont ($40.6 billion), Wyoming ($47.4 billion), and Alaska ($63.6 billion).\n",
      "GDP per capita also varied widely throughout the United States in 2022, with New York ($105,226), Massachusetts ($99,274), and North Dakota ($96,461) recording the three highest GDP per capita figures in the U.S., while Mississippi ($47,572), Arkansas ($54,644), and West Virginia ($54,870) recorded the three lowest GDP per capita figures in the U.S. The District of Columbia, though, recorded a GDP per capita figure far higher than any U.S. state in 2022 at $242,853.\n",

      "Page: National debt of the United States\n",
      "Summary: The national debt of the United States is the total national debt owed by the federal government of the United States to Treasury security holders. The national debt at any point in time is the face value of the then-outstanding Treasury securities that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal agencies. The terms \"national deficit\" and \"national surplus\" usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative amount of debt. In a deficit year the national debt increases as the government needs to borrow funds to finance the deficit, while in a surplus year the debt decreases as more money is received than spent, enabling the government to reduce the debt by buying back some Treasury securities. In general, government debt increases as a result of government spending and decreases from tax or other receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year. There are two components of gross national debt:\n",
      "\"Debt held by the public\" – such as Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government, including those held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve, and foreign, state and local governments.\n",
      "\"Debt held by government accounts\" or \"intragovernmental debt\" – is non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts of programs administered by the federal government, such as the Social Security Trust Fund. Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities.Historically, the U.S. public debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) increases during wars and recessions and then subsequently declines. The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus or via growth of GDP and inflation. For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP had peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but has since reached new highs of up to 134.84% of GDP during the second quarter of 2020. In recent decades, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.

      "ing the XRD transmission data collection, there was no incremental improvement compared\n",
      "with the PLSR models obtained with reﬂection data [14].\n",
      "These results cleared showed that the methodology can be applied for quality control\n",
      "in the beneﬁciation plant, but not suitable for geological survey applications. It is worth\n",
      "mentioning that this method presents several advantages over traditional wet chemistry,\n",
      "mainly due to its speed (less than 5 min to run XRD analysis and obtain the prediction),\n",
